## 💡 Key Insights from Research

### 1. Hybrid Orchestration Works Best
Don't choose between orchestration (centralized) and choreography (distributed). Use both: orchestrator defines high-level goals and constraints, agents choreograph their internal steps within those boundaries.

### 2. Verification Prevents Technical Debt
Mandatory verification before completion (task-verification-skill) prevents the "feels done" syndrome. Objective evidence > developer confidence.

### 3. Research Drives Quality
Every decision backed by current best practices (2025) ensures consistent, high-quality implementations. No reliance on potentially outdated knowledge.

### 4. Parallelism Is Revealed, Not Forced
Well-designed software naturally has module boundaries. Dependency analysis reveals these boundaries, creating natural parallel execution opportunities.

### 5. Continuous Learning Compounds
Small improvements (5-10%) per project compound over time. After 10 projects: 1.05^10 = 1.63x (63% improvement). After 20 projects: 2.65x (165% improvement).

### 6. Observability Builds Trust
Real-time visibility into autonomous execution builds user confidence. Dashboard shows what's happening, why, and whether it's working.

### 7. Cost Optimization Matters
Private LLM infrastructure pays for itself in 6-7 months. Budget-conscious design enables long-term sustainability.
